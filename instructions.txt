Sure! Below, I’ve outlined all the improvements you can make to your project. I will also provide the code for the tests and structure changes, and I’ll rewrite everything in English as you requested.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions to Improve the Project**

1. **Organize the Project Structure**:

   * Create a `src/` folder to separate source code from other files.
   * Split the code into clear modules:

     * `nav_calculator.py`: Contains the main NAV calculation logic.
     * `data_processing.py`: For data processing (if necessary).
     * `visualization.py`: For generating charts or other visual outputs.
   * Create a `tests/` folder for unit tests.

     * Use `pytest` or `unittest` to create tests for your code.
   * Create an `assets/` folder to store images or graphs generated by the project.

2. **Update the README.md**:

   * Add clear sections for `Installation`, `Usage`, `Contributing`, and `License`.
   * Provide examples on how to install, run, and use the project.
   * Follow a consistent and easy-to-read format for each section.

3. **Add Unit Tests**:

   * Create unit tests for your core functions, e.g., the NAV calculation function.
   * Test if the output is correct by comparing actual vs expected values.

4. **Code Refactoring and PEP 8 Compliance**:

   * Ensure the code adheres to PEP 8 standards using a linter like `flake8`.
   * Add docstrings to all functions to explain their purpose and parameters.

5. **Ensure Licensing**:

   * Make sure your `LICENSE` file is present and valid (e.g., GPL-3.0 or MIT License).

6. **Dependency Management**:

   * Update `requirements.txt` to list all dependencies your project needs to run. You can use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to update the list.

### **Final Project Structure**

After implementing the improvements, your project structure will look like this:

# Custody NAV Calculator

Python tool for automating Net Asset Value (NAV) calculation for custody funds.

## Benefits
- Reduces manual errors and saves time.
- Automates the NAV reporting process, improving efficiency.

````

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Required Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DLPietro/custody-nav-calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd custody-nav-calculator
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python src/nav_calculator.py
   ```

2. The tool will compute NAV based on the provided input.

## Testing

### **Code Example for Unit Tests**

Here’s an example of how you can create unit tests for the `nav_calculator.py` script:

1. **Create the test file**: `tests/test_nav_calculator.py`

```python
import unittest
from src.nav_calculator import calculate_nav  # Example function to test

class TestNavCalculator(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_calculate_nav(self):
        data = {
            'assets': [100, 200, 300],
            'liabilities': [50, 100, 150]
        }
        expected_nav = 400  # Expected NAV value
        result = calculate_nav(data)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_nav)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
````

2. **Test the Data Processing Functionality** (if applicable):

Create a file `tests/test_data_processing.py`:

```python
import unittest
from src.data_processing import process_data  # Example data processing function

class TestDataProcessing(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_process_data(self):
        raw_data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        expected_output = [2, 4, 6, 8]  # Example transformation
        result = process_data(raw_data)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

---

### **Code Refactoring Example**

Here’s how you might refactor your `nav_calculator.py`:

**src/nav_calculator.py**

```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_nav(data):
    """
    Calculate Net Asset Value (NAV) from provided data.

    Args:
    - data (dict): Contains 'assets' and 'liabilities' lists.

    Returns:
    - float: The calculated NAV.
    """
    assets_total = sum(data['assets'])
    liabilities_total = sum(data['liabilities'])
    nav = assets_total - liabilities_total
    return nav
```

---

### **Dependencies**

Make sure to update `requirements.txt` to include the necessary libraries for your project. You can generate this file by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have any libraries yet, you might start with:

```text
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
pytest
```

---

### **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you’ll improve your project’s organization, clarity, and maintainability. The code will be better structured, well-tested, and easier to contribute to, which will help you develop better coding practices as you pursue your career as a data analyst.
