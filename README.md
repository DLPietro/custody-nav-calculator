# ðŸ“Š Custody NAV Calculator: How it works

I created a simple Python tool to automate **Net Asset Value (NAV)** calculation for custody funds.

Pros of the script instead of manual Excel reports:
- Pulls live market data (updated using Yahoo Finance)
- Calculates portfolio value
- Adds cash position
- Outputs NAV per share

### Once you update live data, liquidity, or the number of shares, it will be updated automatically!!

## ðŸš€ Purpose of the tool:
- âœ… Reduces manual errors
- âœ… Automates daily reporting / makes it faster
- âœ… Scales to multiple funds
- âœ… Built with tools used in modern finance (Python, pandas, yfinance)

## ðŸ›  How to Run using Google Colab / IDLE
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas yfinance
